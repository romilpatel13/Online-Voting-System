<p>This page will allow you to download pre-defined data sets of financial  reporting information. Some data sets are updated weekly and provided in CSV  files that have been compressed into ZIP files. These files may not open  in a standard spreadsheet program due to their large size. Use of database software to import them is recommended. </p>

<p>Some data sets are offered in two types: </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>as submitted:</strong> data as filed by the political entity (candidates, political parties, electoral district associations, leadership contestants and nomination contestants)</li>
<li><strong>as reviewed:</strong> data that may include updates to the original return by the agent and minor corrections made by Elections Canada</li>
</ul>
