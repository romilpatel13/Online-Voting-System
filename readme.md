# Online Voting System #

I have used JSP and servlets with validations to develop Online voting system as a part of my 2nd-sem project.

As a backend I have used H2 database, which is fully developed in java and is very light weight database.

Features implemented in project : 

-> User will have to sign-up using their passport ID so that no duplicate user can login twice.
-> HTML 5 validations are used, soon going to apply backend validations.
-> Once user has submitted their vote will not be able to vote twice.
-> can see the real time result of candidates
